# Learning Langchain with Python

## Langchain core components
1. Chat Models
2. Prompt templets
3. chains
4. Rags
5. Agents and Tools

## Python environment setup

 - This commands creates a virtual environment for python

```
python -m venv .venv
```

- Command for dot env setup
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Langchain components - Chat Models

## RAGS  - Retrieval Argumented Generations

Problems it solve:
 - RAGs give additional knowledge to LLMs
 - RAGs provide extra knowledge to LLMS that gives better answer to our prompts

Key Concepts:
 - Vector Databases
 - Vector Embeddings


Install chroma db and langchain-chroma (it is a wrapper that connects langchain applications with vector store)

```
pip install chromadb
pip install langchain-chroma

```
